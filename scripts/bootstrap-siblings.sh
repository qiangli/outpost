# Ensure the sibling-path replace targets in go.mod (../sh) exist on
# disk, by cloning the pinned commit from each upstream repo if the
# sibling is missing.
#
# Why: outpost lives in two contexts.
#   1. Inside the dhnt umbrella, ../sh is already mounted as a
#      submodule (dhnt/sh). The script detects it and leaves it
#      alone — one shared copy across every consumer in the
#      umbrella (outpost, ycode, …).
#   2. As a standalone clone (CI runner, contributor checkout), the
#      sibling doesn't exist. The script clones it into ../sh at
#      the SHA in .sibling-pins.
#
# Idempotent. Safe to re-run.
